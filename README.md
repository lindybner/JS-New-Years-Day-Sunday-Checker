# JavaScript January 1st Sunday Checker (2014-2050)

## Overview

This JavaScript exercise program determines if the 1st of January falls on a Sunday between the years 2014 and 2050. The script utilizes a loop to iterate through the specified range, creates a `Date` object for January 1 of each year, and checks if the day of the week is Sunday. If it is, the program prints or logs a message indicating that January 1st is a Sunday for that year.

## Example Output

If January 1st is a Sunday for a particular year, the script will log a message like:

`In 2022, January 1st is a Sunday.`
